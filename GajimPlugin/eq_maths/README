THIS PLUGIN IS NOT REALLY TESTED !

Installation:

Copy the directory to your gajim/plugins directory.
Copy eqliblin.so somewhere and modify the LoadLibrary line in eq_math.py to the fullpath of your .so... I told you, this is a dev version !

To write an equation juste type "blablabla (eq:(mymaths)) blablablala"
