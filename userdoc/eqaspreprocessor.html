                <p>
                    Yes, I can hear you, but yes, you need a preprocessor for 
                    some equations. For a better documentation, you can inline
                    a nice ASCII art equation, and for some formula manipulation,
                    you can directly process it within your source code.

                    The important point here is the special comment. Let's see
                    the result before explaining it.

                <p>
                    The little embedded markup format is really simple. To use it, you
                    must write it in <strong>mono line</strong> comment. Let's digg a bit
                    in the definition which trigger the processing :
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>Eq:</code></td>
                        <td>Tell Eq that he can process something</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>format</code></td>
                        <td>The eq command to call, you are limited here, you don't have
                            all the command at disposition.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>&lt;@&lt;</code></td>
                        <td>Begin marker of output</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>&gt;@&gt;</code></td>
                        <td>End marker of output</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The <code>&lt;@&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;@&gt;</code> are ugly, but
                    they permit the preprocessor to re-analyze the file and update
                    the previous render, if someone got a better idea, please send
                    me a mail about it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3><a name="whopreprocessor">Which languages are available?</a></h3>
                <p>Let's see!</p>
<!-- %% eq show --languages -->
<!-- %%% -->
                <p>
                    As you can see, many languages are already supported for formatting.
                    Some language name are common due to the similarity of their mono line
                    comment format. If you want your favorite language to be included here,
                    please drop me a mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the moment Eq use the file extension to guess the language. It
                    might change in the future.
