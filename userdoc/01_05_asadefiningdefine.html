            <h2>Eq as a defining define for your definitions</h2>

            <p>
                From now on, we will show definitions stored in files. You
                still can use the expression only definition, but it's going
                to be limited
            </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3><a name="definition">Definition</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Let's get things started slowly by <i>binding</i> a variable and
                    using it.
                </p>
<!-- %% cat var_bind.txt -->

<!-- %% eq eval -f var_bind.txt -->

                <p>
                    The <code>:=</code> operator let you set the value of a variable.
                The right and side of the operator (3 here), is evaluated at the definition
                site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>;</code> separate all your definitions. Only the value of the last
                    expression is displayed. During the evaluation of an expression if a variable
                    is found, we check if it's bound, if it is, we replace the variable by the
                    bound value and continue evaluation.
                </p>

                    You can define function the same way than variable, but using a
                    slightly different syntax.

                    It's possible to have function with multiple parameters too

                    You may now want to define functions with many if to change behaviour
                    of your definitions and everything. Sad news, there is no <code>if</code>,
                    no <code>while</code> and no <code>for</code> in <i>Eq Language</i>. But
                    the language provide an other mean to control behaviour. It's the power of...
                </p>
                <h1>Unification</h1>
                <p>
                    We are now going to define a function whose behaviour change in function
                    of the value of it's parameters.

<!-- %% eq eval -f fun_unif1.txt -->

                <p>
                    In the first call <code>uniftest</code> try to match the first argument (here 3)
                    with it's first pattern (here 3, also, nice). As these two value <i>Match</i> it then
                    continue with the variable <code>a</code>. As a is a variable, it can match with
                    anything at least once. So the first definition of the <code>uniftest</code>
                    match with the given parameters so <code>2 * a</code> is returned but <code>a</code>
                    is substituted by <code>12</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second call to <code>uniftest</code> We try to match 1 to 3, which can't work.
                    So we jump to the second definition and by the same principle, <code>2 * 2</code>
                    is returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rule for choosing function definition is to take the first definition which
                    match the given argument. So definition order matters.

                <h3><a name="ifcreation">Creating a if</a></h3>
                <p>
                    We now have all the tools necessary to create a <code>if</code> construct
                    by ourselves. By using a specific value to determine which definition of the
                    function to choose, we can write it easily.

                <p>For the french reader only : "The yes need the no to win against the no" (JP Raffarin)</p>
                <p>
                That was easy. When you find a <code>--</code> token, the rest of the line is considered
                as a comment. You can write <code>{- multiline comment like in this sample -}</code>.
                It's time to introduce you to some special values :
                    <ul>
                        <li>true</li>
                        <li>false</li>
                    </ul>
                    Which are the <i>boolean</i> values. All comparisons operators generate a boolean value.
                    So to define an if, it's a good thing to use them. The if got a third case, which is a bit
                    weird. In a normal utilisation, an <code>if</code> should always use boolean value as first
                    argument (the <i>conditional</i> argument. The reason of this definition need an example :
                </p>
<!-- %% cat pattern_failure.txt -->
<!-- %%% -->

<!-- %% eq eval -f pattern_failure.txt -->
<!-- %%% -->
                <p>
                    Your first matching error. Cute isn't it? So instead of getting a harsh crash,
                    we return the variable <code>undefined</code>, which can help you to reuse some result later.
                    You can bound the <code>undefined</code> variable like any other variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I told you that the <i>Eq Language</i> didn't possess an if construct. I have
                    to admit that I lied a bit. There is an if function, defined in the standard library.
                    You can read the standard library (which is rather thin at the moment), but if you
                    modify it the modification won't be taken into account.
